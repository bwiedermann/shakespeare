    <h4 ng-show="ctrl.selected == 'Themes'"> This tab gives visualizations about themes. The word cloud below shows the 50 most frequent words in the play, sized relative to frequency. Hover over a word to see how often it appears. Click on a word to see its corresponding donut graph. Each donut graph shows a breakdown of which characters speak a given word. Hover over a character in the donut graph to see which lines that character speaks in the theme distribution graph at the bottom. The theme distribution graph shows where a given word (theme) appears in the play.</h4>
    <h4 ng-show="ctrl.selected == 'Visualizations'"> This tab gives visualizations about relationships between characters. The theme graph below shows how many lines each character shares with the other characters in the play. To see a specific character's relationships, hover over the character's name. The thickness of each arc represents the number of lines shared. </h4>
    <h4 ng-show="ctrl.selected == 'Characters'"> This tab gives visualizations about the characters. The heat map below shows the number of scenes shared by two characters in the play. To see the number of lines a character speaks for each scene in this play, feel free to click on a character, and scrolling down will display the visualization. Note that to deselect the bar graph for a character, simply click on the character's name again. </h4>
    <h4 class="sides-description" ng-show="ctrl.selected == 'Sides'"> This tab is the sides feature. “Side” is theatre jargon for a small piece of a script. In Shakespeare’s time, the actors sometimes got only their lines, not the whole play. To generate sides for a given character, act, and scene, select the appropriate items in the dropdowns and click "Generate sides." Check the "Show previous characters" checkbox to enable/disable displaying the previous character's names.  </h4>
