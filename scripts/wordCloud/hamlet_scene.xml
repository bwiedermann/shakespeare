<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE III.  A heath near Forres.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Thunder. Enter the three Witches</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where hast thou been, sister?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Killing swine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sister, where thou?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,</LINE>
<LINE>And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:--</LINE>
<LINE>'Give me,' quoth I:</LINE>
<LINE>'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.</LINE>
<LINE>Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger:</LINE>
<LINE>But in a sieve I'll thither sail,</LINE>
<LINE>And, like a rat without a tail,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll give thee a wind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou'rt kind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I another.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I myself have all the other,</LINE>
<LINE>And the very ports they blow,</LINE>
<LINE>All the quarters that they know</LINE>
<LINE>I' the shipman's card.</LINE>
<LINE>I will drain him dry as hay:</LINE>
<LINE>Sleep shall neither night nor day</LINE>
<LINE>Hang upon his pent-house lid;</LINE>
<LINE>He shall live a man forbid:</LINE>
<LINE>Weary se'nnights nine times nine</LINE>
<LINE>Shall he dwindle, peak and pine:</LINE>
<LINE>Though his bark cannot be lost,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet it shall be tempest-tost.</LINE>
<LINE>Look what I have.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Show me, show me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here I have a pilot's thumb,</LINE>
<LINE>Wreck'd as homeward he did come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Drum within</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A drum, a drum!</LINE>
<LINE>Macbeth doth come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The weird sisters, hand in hand,</LINE>
<LINE>Posters of the sea and land,</LINE>
<LINE>Thus do go about, about:</LINE>
<LINE>Thrice to thine and thrice to mine</LINE>
<LINE>And thrice again, to make up nine.</LINE>
<LINE>Peace! the charm's wound up.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter MACBETH and BANQUO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So foul and fair a day I have not seen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BANQUO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these</LINE>
<LINE>So wither'd and so wild in their attire,</LINE>
<LINE>That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught</LINE>
<LINE>That man may question? You seem to understand me,</LINE>
<LINE>By each at once her chappy finger laying</LINE>
<LINE>Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet your beards forbid me to interpret</LINE>
<LINE>That you are so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak, if you can: what are you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, thane of Cawdor!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BANQUO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear</LINE>
<LINE>Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,</LINE>
<LINE>Are ye fantastical, or that indeed</LINE>
<LINE>Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner</LINE>
<LINE>You greet with present grace and great prediction</LINE>
<LINE>Of noble having and of royal hope,</LINE>
<LINE>That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.</LINE>
<LINE>If you can look into the seeds of time,</LINE>
<LINE>And say which grain will grow and which will not,</LINE>
<LINE>Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear</LINE>
<LINE>Your favours nor your hate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hail!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hail!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hail!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not so happy, yet much happier.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:</LINE>
<LINE>So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Witch</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:</LINE>
<LINE>By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;</LINE>
<LINE>But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,</LINE>
<LINE>A prosperous gentleman; and to be king</LINE>
<LINE>Stands not within the prospect of belief,</LINE>
<LINE>No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence</LINE>
<LINE>You owe this strange intelligence? or why</LINE>
<LINE>Upon this blasted heath you stop our way</LINE>
<LINE>With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Witches vanish</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BANQUO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,</LINE>
<LINE>And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted</LINE>
<LINE>As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BANQUO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Were such things here as we do speak about?</LINE>
<LINE>Or have we eaten on the insane root</LINE>
<LINE>That takes the reason prisoner?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your children shall be kings.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BANQUO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You shall be king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BANQUO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter ROSS and ANGUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The king hath happily received, Macbeth,</LINE>
<LINE>The news of thy success; and when he reads</LINE>
<LINE>Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,</LINE>
<LINE>His wonders and his praises do contend</LINE>
<LINE>Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,</LINE>
<LINE>In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,</LINE>
<LINE>He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,</LINE>
<LINE>Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,</LINE>
<LINE>Strange images of death. As thick as hail</LINE>
<LINE>Came post with post; and every one did bear</LINE>
<LINE>Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,</LINE>
<LINE>And pour'd them down before him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We are sent</LINE>
<LINE>To give thee from our royal master thanks;</LINE>
<LINE>Only to herald thee into his sight,</LINE>
<LINE>Not pay thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And, for an earnest of a greater honour,</LINE>
<LINE>He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor:</LINE>
<LINE>In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!</LINE>
<LINE>For it is thine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BANQUO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, can the devil speak true?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me</LINE>
<LINE>In borrow'd robes?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who was the thane lives yet;</LINE>
<LINE>But under heavy judgment bears that life</LINE>
<LINE>Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined</LINE>
<LINE>With those of Norway, or did line the rebel</LINE>
<LINE>With hidden help and vantage, or that with both</LINE>
<LINE>He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;</LINE>
<LINE>But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,</LINE>
<LINE>Have overthrown him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!</LINE>
<LINE>The greatest is behind.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To ROSS and ANGUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Thanks for your pains.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To BANQUO</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Do you not hope your children shall be kings,</LINE>
<LINE>When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me</LINE>
<LINE>Promised no less to them?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BANQUO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That trusted home</LINE>
<LINE>Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,</LINE>
<LINE>Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:</LINE>
<LINE>And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,</LINE>
<LINE>The instruments of darkness tell us truths,</LINE>
<LINE>Win us with honest trifles, to betray's</LINE>
<LINE>In deepest consequence.</LINE>
<LINE>Cousins, a word, I pray you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR> Two truths are told,</LINE>
<LINE>As happy prologues to the swelling act</LINE>
<LINE>Of the imperial theme.--I thank you, gentlemen.</LINE>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  This supernatural soliciting</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,</LINE>
<LINE>Why hath it given me earnest of success,</LINE>
<LINE>Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:</LINE>
<LINE>If good, why do I yield to that suggestion</LINE>
<LINE>Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair</LINE>
<LINE>And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,</LINE>
<LINE>Against the use of nature? Present fears</LINE>
<LINE>Are less than horrible imaginings:</LINE>
<LINE>My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,</LINE>
<LINE>Shakes so my single state of man that function</LINE>
<LINE>Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is</LINE>
<LINE>But what is not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BANQUO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look, how our partner's rapt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me,</LINE>
<LINE>Without my stir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BANQUO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>New horrors come upon him,</LINE>
<LINE>Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould</LINE>
<LINE>But with the aid of use.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>                Come what come may,</LINE>
<LINE>Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BANQUO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought</LINE>
<LINE>With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains</LINE>
<LINE>Are register'd where every day I turn</LINE>
<LINE>The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.</LINE>
<LINE>Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,</LINE>
<LINE>The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak</LINE>
<LINE>Our free hearts each to other.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BANQUO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very gladly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACBETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Till then, enough. Come, friends.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
